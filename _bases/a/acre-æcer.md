note: <span>In the word sum for acreage, it is odd that the &LT;-age&GT; suffix does not replace the single, final, non-syllabic &LT;e&GT;. It is possible that this word was once conceived of as a compound word made up of two bases, &LT;acre&GT; and &LT;age&GT;. Thus, the  &LT;a&GT; in &LT;age&GT; would not replace the single, final, non-syllabic &LT;e&GT;. It is also possible that *acrage looked too much like the base &LT;rage&GT; with a prefix &LT;ac-&GT; and that the choice of &LT;acreage&GT; in spelling helps readers to better access the meaning of the word.</span>
